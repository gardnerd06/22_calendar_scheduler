# 22_calendar_scheduler

This is a work day scheduler.
This is calendar scheduler was given to me in Module 5 of our bootcamp. The CSS and HTML code was given to us but we were responsible for creating the javascript and using bootstrap an day js to add functionality for this project. I created the javascript code in order to allow users to create and save their user inputs into their calendar.

#Description

The task at hand for this assignment was to build working code in order to give functionality to this calendar. I worked with Bootstrap and DayJS and Javascript in order to fix the functionality of this project. I added code to display the time, as well as dynamically save user inputs and persist that data to return if the user refreshes the page.
